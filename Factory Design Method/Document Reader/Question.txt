Scenario: You are developing a document reader application that can read different types of documents (e.g., PDF, Word, Text). Each document type has its own way of being read.


Task: Implement a Factory Method Pattern to create different types of document readers. Your solution should include:


An abstract DocumentReader class with a method read().

Concrete classes for each type of document reader (e.g., PDFReader, WordReader, TextReader).

A DocumentReaderFactory interface with a method createReader().

Concrete factory classes for each type of document reader (e.g., PDFReaderFactory, WordReaderFactory, TextReaderFactory).

A DocumentReaderApp class that uses the factory to create and use document readers.
